## üéØ Note

As a music producer myself, I understand the challenges and needs during the music creation process. This tool aims to provide Ableton users with an intelligent and practical auxiliary system to make the creative process more natural and smooth. I always adhere to the core concept of "assisting creation" rather than blindly pursuing AI to generate complete musical notes ‚Äì truly moving musical works are inseparable from unique human creativity and artistic perception, which is currently beyond the reach of AI technology.
